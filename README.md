# SwiftUI Tutorial - Apple Developer

This project is a simple application developed as part of the official SwiftUI tutorial provided by Apple on their Developer website.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and understand the core concepts of SwiftUI, including how to build dynamic interfaces, use data flow and state management, and work with views and modifiers. The tutorial walks through various features of SwiftUI by creating a multi-featured app.

This repository serves as an educational resource and is not intended to be a standalone application, but rather a demonstration of SwiftUI basics and best practices.
